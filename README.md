# terraform_basic_02
# a terraform code with variables using the 'local_file' and 'random_pet' resources to create an 'imaginary' company and its departments as directory and subdirectories with randomnised department head name created in respective txt files
# this terraform is created with learning purpose more than optimisation in mind
# this terraform code with variables create an 'imaginary' company (company_x) and its departments as directory and subdirectories with randomnised department head name created in respective txt files
# objectives of this terraform code is to give you the basic understanding of how terraform with variables work by using the 'local_file' & 'random_pet' resources to:
# (1) create directory and subdirectories in your local machine
# (2) create txt files (with randomly created 'content(s)') in the subdirectories
# please substitute 'your_user_name' with your own user name
# go ahead and change the the directory/subdirectries, file name in the variables.tf and apply and re-apply the terraform code and see what happen
